# 24online-client-login
A command-line tool that keeps you logged in to 24online server

## Note
I built this handy script to help deal with the frustration of logging into my ISP server again and again. That was around the December of 2016, so a loong time ago. I don't intend to continue development on this, nor do I have the means to do that, I don't have a 24online connection anymore. So I'll be archiving this repo. You're welcome to use this—if it still works—or continue development by making a fork. For anything else, shoot me an email.
